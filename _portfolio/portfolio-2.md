title: "Study Of OOB Error in Random Forests"
excerpt: "Second part to my DataScience portfolio on bootstrapping. This time investigating how bootstrapping is used in Random forests. Consequentially, we have out of bag samples which can be used as an alternative to cross validation methods. I wanted to investigate the error using OOB over CV for different values of 'max_features' in the random forest."
