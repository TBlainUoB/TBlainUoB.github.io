excerpt: "I've learnt about bootstrapping as a statistical concept for years now, yet never been sure how to justify applying the technique. In this paper I investigate bootstrapping further to gain some insight into uses and attempt to understand reasons for choosing this method."

Abstract:
Bootstrapping, first introduced by Bradley Efron in 1979, is a powerful tool which allows us to conduct inference about an unknown population from sample data by iterative resampling with replacement of the sample data.
In this paper we will provide an introduction to bootstrapping techniques, introduce percentile and Bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) confidence intervals from the bootstrap distribution and conclude with an example on real world data bootstrapping and producing confidence intervals for a mean statistic given a sample.
